The steps are as follows:
1. Data analysis of the individual features which comprises of both univariate and bivariate analysis.
2. Complete feature engineering.
3. Predecting the accuracy using logistic regression and random forest classifier.

Accracy acheived by the models:
1. Logistic regression: 86.79%
2. Random forest classifier: 100%
